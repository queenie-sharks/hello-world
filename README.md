# hello-world
I'm from Cape Cod, Massachusetts and I study marine biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). I'm currently a senior and am working on my thesis. My thesis is about microplastics in bowhead whales. Once my thesis is written, I will go through the process of publishing my work. I'll be a graduated undergraduate student with published work.
